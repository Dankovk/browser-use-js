## Core Module Differences

### Agent Module
- Python uses Pydantic models for validation, TypeScript uses plain interfaces
- Python has `@time_execution_async` decorator for step method
- Python has telemetry setup in constructor
- Python has more robust error handling with specific error types
- Python uses `model_dump_json` for serialization

### Message Manager
- Python has message manager in separate directory
- Python uses Pydantic models for validation
- Python has more robust token counting with specific model support
- Python has better error handling and logging
- Python uses `model_dump_json` for serialization

### Browser Implementation
- TypeScript now uses Chromium by default
- TypeScript now has equivalent Chrome instance connection support
- Python has more robust anti-detection measures
- Python's error handling is more comprehensive
- TypeScript browser management now matches Python's

### Context Management
- Python's element location strategy is more reliable
- Python's frame and shadow DOM handling is better
- Python's event handling is cleaner
- Python's file uploader detection is more accurate
- TypeScript needs to enhance its DOM interaction capabilities

### DOM Service
- Python has comprehensive shadow DOM support with `querySelectorDeep` and `querySelectorAllDeep` methods
- Python has extensive iframe support with methods for content access and querying
- Python uses comprehensive visibility checks including opacity, display, and viewport
- Python has separate methods for building DOM tree with shadow DOM and iframes

### Controller & Registry
- Python uses Pydantic models while TypeScript uses Zod schemas
- Python's registry has better error handling and type safety
- Python's registry has a cleaner way of creating parameter models from function signatures
- Python's registry handles async/sync functions automatically
- Python's `ActionResult` is simpler and more consistent
- TypeScript's `ActionResult` has an extra `success` field that's not in Python

### Type System
- Python uses Pydantic models and dataclasses for validation
- TypeScript uses plain interfaces without runtime validation
- Python has more comprehensive DOM types with better separation
- Python has better history tracking with proper serialization

### Error Handling
- Python has more specific error types
- Python has proper error formatting with trace support
- Python has better error message organization
- Python has better error recovery strategies
- Python has better error logging

### Configuration & Validation
- Python uses Pydantic models for configuration
- Python has better configuration loading with multiple source support
- Python has better configuration validation with runtime checks
- Python has better type coercion and default values

### Logging & Telemetry
- Python has better logging configuration with proper log levels
- Python has proper event types with validation
- Python has better event tracking and filtering
- Python has better performance monitoring with metric types

## Action Items

### High Priority
1. Enhance DOM interaction capabilities:
   - Improve element location strategy
   - Enhance frame and shadow DOM handling
   - Clean up event handling
   - Improve file uploader detection

2. Implement more robust anti-detection measures:
   - Add comprehensive browser fingerprint protection
   - Improve stealth mode capabilities
   - Add more sophisticated bot detection avoidance

### Medium Priority
1. Improve error handling:
   - Add specific error types
   - Add proper error formatting
   - Improve error recovery strategies
   - Add comprehensive logging

2. Enhance type system:
   - Add runtime validation using Zod
   - Improve DOM type hierarchy
   - Add proper serialization methods
   - Add comprehensive attributes

### Low Priority
1. Improve testing:
   - Add real-world scenario tests
   - Add performance measurement
   - Add token counting for LLM
   - Add proper cleanup with context managers

2. Enhance documentation and tooling:
   - Improve documentation
   - Add performance optimizations
   - Add more examples
   - Add debugging tools

Each task will be tackled in order of priority, with high-priority items being addressed first. The focus will be on ensuring core functionality and reliability before moving on to optimizations and enhancements.
